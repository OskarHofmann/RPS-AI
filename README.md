# RPS-AI
This project is based on the freeCodeCamp "Rock Paper Scissors" project:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors

The game is Rock-Paper-Scissors. Two players select either rock, paper or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock. If both players select the same, the round is a tie.

The goal of this project is to program an "AI" RPS player that can beat other human or AI players based on the list of their last moves.
